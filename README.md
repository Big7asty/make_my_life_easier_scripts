# Scripts

Repo of tools I have built that make life easier, but not worth a dedicated repo

# ap_sync_assist

Works best when copied to /usr/local/bin after making executable.

# Mon-down

Brings the interface down, destroys it if its virtual. Works best when copied to /usr/local/bin after making executable.
